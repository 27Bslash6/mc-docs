# idk Server

The main survival server - vanilla Minecraft enhanced with quality-of-life mods.

## Quick Info

| | |
|---|---|
| **Version** | Minecraft 1.21.1 (Fabric) |
| **Address (Java)** | `mc.fnord.lol` |
| **Address (Bedrock)** | `mc.fnord.lol` port `19132` |
| **Client Mods** | None required (but recommended) |
| **Difficulty** | Normal |

## Recommended Setup

For the best experience, use **Fabulously Optimized** via Prism Launcher:

1. Download [Prism Launcher](https://prismlauncher.org/download/)
2. Click **Add Instance** → **Modrinth** tab
3. Search for **Fabulously Optimized**
4. Select version **1.21.1**
5. Click **OK** to install
6. Launch and connect to `mc.fnord.lol`

This gives you:

- **Much better FPS** (Sodium, Lithium, FerriteCore)
- **Zoom** (like OptiFine) - press C
- **Shader support** (Iris)
- **Dynamic lights** (hold a torch, it lights up)
- 100% vanilla-compatible

!!! tip "Why Fabulously Optimized?"
    Vanilla Minecraft is poorly optimized. Fabulously Optimized is a curated collection of performance mods that work together. You'll get 2-3x better FPS on most systems.
