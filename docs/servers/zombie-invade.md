## :material-shield: Survival Guide

### First Day Priorities

1. :material-tree: **Punch trees** - get wood immediately
2. :material-pickaxe: **Make tools** - wood → stone → iron
3. :material-home: **Find shelter** - cave, village, anything
4. :material-door: **SEAL YOURSELF IN** before dark

### Base Building Tips

| Do | Don't |
|----|-------|
| :material-check: Use stone/cobblestone | :material-close: Use wood (they break it) |
| :material-check: Multiple layers of walls | :material-close: Single-layer anything |
| :material-check: Light EVERYTHING | :material-close: Leave dark spots |
| :material-check: Elevated entrances | :material-close: Ground-level doors |

### Night Survival

!!! tip "Stuck Outside at Night?"
    Dig into a hillside. Seal the entrance with dirt. Wait it out. Pride kills - hiding keeps you alive.

## :material-account-group: Teamwork

This is **much** easier with friends:

- :material-hammer: One person builds, one gathers
- :material-shield: Take shifts watching at night
- :material-treasure-chest: Share resources - hoarding gets everyone killed
- :material-hospital: Rescue downed teammates (if you can)
