## Technical

### The server is laggy

The servers run in Australia. If you're far away, you might have higher ping. Try:

- Lowering render distance
- Turning off fancy graphics

### I can't connect

1. Check you're using the right address
2. Make sure you're on the right Minecraft version
3. For modpack servers, make sure you have the mods installed
4. Ask Dad for help

### How do I install mods for the modpack servers?

Use **Prism Launcher** - it's the best way to manage Minecraft modpacks:

1. Download [Prism Launcher](https://prismlauncher.org/download/)
2. Click **Add Instance** → **Modrinth** tab
3. Search for the modpack name
4. Install and launch!

See the individual server pages for specific modpack names.
