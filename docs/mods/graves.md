# Universal Graves

When you die, your items appear in a gravestone instead of scattering everywhere.

## How It Works

1. You die (it happens)
2. A gravestone appears at your death location
3. Your items are safely stored inside
4. Walk up to it and **right-click** to retrieve your stuff

## Features

- **Items are safe** - Other players can't take your stuff
- **No despawn timer** - Graves don't disappear after 5 minutes like dropped items
- **Death coordinates** - Shown in chat when you die
- **Works underwater** - Graves appear even in the ocean

## Finding Your Grave

Lost? Try these:

1. **Check chat** - Death coordinates are shown when you die
2. **Use the map** - Visit [map.fnord.lol](https://map.fnord.lol) and zoom in
3. **Retrace your steps** - Think about where you were exploring

## Tips

- **Screenshot death coords** - In case you forget
- **Bring a boat** - If you died in the ocean
- **Watch for mobs** - The thing that killed you might still be there

!!! note "Grave Contents"
    Your grave contains everything you were carrying and wearing. XP is lost as normal (some drops as orbs at death location).
