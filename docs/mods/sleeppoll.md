# SleepPoll

Not everyone needs to sleep! Start a vote to skip the night.

## How It Works

1. One player gets in bed
2. A message appears in chat for all players
3. Players can click the chat message to vote
4. If enough players vote yes, night is skipped

## Voting

When someone sleeps, you'll see a chat message like:

> **[Sleep]** PlayerName wants to sleep. Click to vote! [Yes] [No]

Click **[Yes]** to vote for skipping night, or **[No]** to vote against.

## Threshold

The vote passes when enough online players vote yes. You don't need everyone - just a majority.

## Why This Exists

In vanilla Minecraft, **all** players must sleep to skip night. This is annoying when:

- Someone is AFK
- Someone is busy fighting mobs
- Someone is in another dimension (Nether/End)

SleepPoll fixes this by only needing some players to agree.

## Tips

- **Vote quickly** - The poll has a time limit
- **AFK players** - Don't count toward the required votes
- **Night mobs** - Will still spawn until the vote passes

!!! tip "Phantoms"
    Phantoms spawn after 3 days without sleep. Voting to skip night counts as sleeping for phantom prevention!
