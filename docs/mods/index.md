# Mods Overview (idk Server)

The **idk** server runs these quality-of-life mods. They're all **server-side** - you don't need to install anything!

## Gameplay Mods

| Mod | What It Does |
|-----|--------------|
| [**FLAN**](flan.md) | Claim and protect your land |
| [**Universal Graves**](graves.md) | Your items stay safe when you die |
| [**FallingTree**](fallingtree.md) | Chop one log, fell the whole tree |
| [**JEI**](jei.md) | View crafting recipes in-game |
| [**SleepPoll**](sleeppoll.md) | Vote to skip the night |

## Utility Mods

| Mod | What It Does |
|-----|--------------|
| **BlueMap** | 3D world map at [map.fnord.lol](https://map.fnord.lol) |
| **Geyser** | Lets Bedrock players join |
| **Distant Horizons** | See farther (LOD terrain) |

## How Server-Side Mods Work

These mods run on the server, not your computer. They use clever tricks to work with vanilla Minecraft:

- **FLAN** uses a golden hoe and chat messages for claiming
- **Graves** renders as an armor stand that looks like a gravestone
- **JEI** sends recipe data through the vanilla recipe book

This means:

- No downloads required
- Works with vanilla Java Edition
- Works with Bedrock Edition (via Geyser)
- Always up to date (server controls the version)
