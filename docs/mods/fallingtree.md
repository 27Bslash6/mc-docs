# FallingTree

Chop one log, fell the whole tree. No more pillar towers of leaves.

## How It Works

1. Chop the **bottom log** of a tree with an axe
2. The entire tree breaks at once
3. All logs drop as items

That's it. Simple.

## Breaking Normally

Sometimes you want to chop just one log. **Hold sneak (crouch)** while chopping to break blocks one at a time like vanilla.

## Tool Durability

Your axe takes durability damage for each log broken:

- Small tree (5 logs) = 5 durability
- Big tree (20 logs) = 20 durability

Bring backup axes for long logging sessions!

## Tips

- **Replant!** - Saplings drop as normal, plant them
- **Use for mega trees** - 2x2 jungle/spruce trees chop all at once
- **Careful near builds** - Make sure you're not chopping a support log

!!! tip "Efficiency Enchant"
    Axes with Efficiency chop faster, but FallingTree still works the same way - one chop, whole tree.
